# Movie Ratings Data Dashboard

**Live Link:** [Dashboard](https://movie-ratings-dash.streamlit.app/)

The goal of this dashboard is to answer the following four questions:

1. What's the breakdown of genres for the movies that were rated?
2. Which genres have the highest viewer satisfaction (highest ratings)?
3. How does mean rating change across movie release years?
4. What are the 5 best-rated movies that have at least 50 ratings? At least 150 ratings?

Technologies:
- Python
- Libs: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, streamlit
- Deployment: Streamlit Community Cloud

Improvements:
- Keep axes ranges consistent when filters change to maintain a constant frame of reference across data mutations
- Improve aesthetic 
- Focus more intensely on cohesive data storytelling
